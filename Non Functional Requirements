Some main non-functional requirements to remember - scalability, maintainability, performance, portability, security, reliability

1. Performance requirements: 
        Response type, 
        throughput (the quantity of transactions or processes that the system needs to make in a given amount of time), 
        Scalability (how thw system can handle growing workload and user base)
2. Reliability:
        Perform functions consistently and accurately over time 
3. Scalability:
        Ability to grow in data volume and user load
4. Availability:
        
Usability:
security: 
maintainability:
Efficiency:
portability:
Reusability:
